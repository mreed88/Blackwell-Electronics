# Blackwell Electronics
My job is to use data mining and machine-learning techniques to investigate the patterns in customer sales data and provide insight into customer buying trends and preferences. The inferences I draw from the patterns in the data will help the business make data-driven decisions about sales and marketing activities.

•	Using decision tree classifiers to investigate classification and regression problems
•	Applying cross-validation methods
•	Interpreting and drawing inferences from the results of data mining
•	Assessing the predictive performance of classifiers by examining key error metrics
•	Identifying where learning methods fail and gain insight into why with error analysis
•	Drawing relationships between learner performance and measured features to help understand model performance
•	Conducting feature selection to investigate the correlation between different features in a dataset
•	Presenting data mining results to management

Do customers in different regions spend more per transaction? Which regions spend the most/least?
Are there differences in the age of customers between regions? If so, can we predict the age of a customer in a region based on other demographic data?
Can we predict the amount a customer will spend per transaction based on other data we have collected about that customer?
Finally, we need to investigate Martin’s hypothesis: Is there any correlation between age of a customer and if the transaction was made online or in the store? Do any other factors predict if a customer will buy online or in our stores?
